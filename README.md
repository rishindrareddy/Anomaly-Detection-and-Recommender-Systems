# Anomaly-Detection-and-Recommender-Systems

## Anomaly Detection

Anomalies are outliers exhibiting different behaviour when compared to other data examples. So if we can successfully identify the outliers we can identify the anomalies.

Dataset consist of datacenter server data, Always visualize the data to identify the pattern, which will help us comming up with the algorithm that best suits for data.

After implementing gaussian distribution algorithm, outliers in the datasets are shown below:

## Recommender Systems

Algorithm used: collaborative filtering

Collaborative filtering takes into account the movies users has rated and predicts the rating for other movies, based on the results recommends the highest rated movies.
